# An mpremote based command system

* WARNING:
* YOU NEED TO INSTALL MPREMOTE
* TO YOUR DEFAULT PYTHON INSTALLATION
* DUE TO LIMITATIONS BY COMMAND HANDLING WITH VENVS
* (pip install mpremote)

### Intended use for micro controllers

Works like a charm with ESP-32-WroOM

It can show you all the connected ports and devices
![Show device list](resources/devices.png)

It runs active files on the micro-controller, syncs data back and forth, 
clears the micro-controller and more...

As i said its just a Wrapper for mpremote so that needs to be installed.

### FYI:
- All of this can be done with mpremote only
